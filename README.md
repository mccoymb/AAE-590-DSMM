# AAE-590-DSMM
This is for Purdue's AAE 590 DSMM class. I have no clue what to do with this so good luck to me
I believe this gives participation points if I do the inclass examples.
I am Morgan McCoy, an aerospace Student at Purdue who as of 1/28/2025 is dual enrolled as an undegrad and a graduate student.
I have never used github, have only slighlty touched python and C and code primarily in MATLAB.
